<div style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; margin: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Here is some text that should show up by default in Plex Sans. Here is another sentence with 
        <strong>some text in a strong tag</strong> and some <em>other text that should be italicized</em> 
        and even some that should be <strong><em>bold and italic</em></strong>. Whew!
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Serif', serif; font-size: 16px;">
        Here is the same text, but in Plex Serif and all we did was change the font-family. Here is another 
        sentence with <strong>some text in a strong tag</strong> and some <em>other text that should be italicized</em> 
        and even some that should be <strong><em>bold and italic</em></strong>. Whew!
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 100;">A nice headline in a very thin weight</h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 100; font-size: 16px;">
        Here is the same text, but in Plex Sans and shifted to lighter weights, and again all we did was change 
        the font-family. Here is another sentence with <strong>some text in a strong tag</strong> and some <em>other text 
        that should be italicized</em> and even some that should be <strong><em>bold and italic</em></strong>. Whew!
