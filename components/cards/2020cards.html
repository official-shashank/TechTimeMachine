            In the 2020s, web design embraced neomorphism and glassmorphism, creating visually appealing interfaces that mimic real-world materials. Neomorphic designs utilize soft shadows and highlights, giving a sense of depth and tactile interaction. Glassmorphism, characterized by its frosted glass effect, became popular for its ability to blend layers and provide depth. The emphasis was on creating immersive and modern user experiences while ensuring accessibility and performance.
