            The 2010s ushered in the flat design trend, characterized by minimalistic aesthetics and the removal of 3D effects. The focus shifted to usability and performance, with clean lines, vibrant colors, and intuitive navigation. Icons and typography took center stage, supported by responsive designs that adapted seamlessly across devices. Material Design by Google emerged during this era, introducing subtle shadows to create a sense of depth while maintaining simplicity.
